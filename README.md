# CNN-in-C
Convolutional Neural Network in C 
Completed as a project for my Artifical Intelligence class at CCSU. 
main.c is a C program that trains a CNN using the MNIST database of handrwitten digits. Additionally, I have a written a program to test the resulting weights and biases generated during the training.
generate.c creates randomly generated weights and biases to start the training from.
Additionally, the uploaded word document is the research paper associated with this work.
